# Extension Icon Guidelines

## Why do we need guidelines?

Icon guidelines are crucial for ensuring that all extension icons fit seamlessly into Shopware UI layouts and avoid any alignment issues. By providing consistency between icons, the result is a cleaner and more uniform look that is visually appealing and easier to digest for our users.
Additionally, it ensures that all icons are of similar quality, making it easier for customers to differentiate between different extensions and make informed decisions when choosing which ones to purchase.

## Building the icon

### Technical requirements

- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPEG
- No transparency (we will replace all transparency with a white background as fallback)
- Shape: Full-bleed square (rounded corners, shadows, borders or similar will be added by our applications related to the use case)

### Elements

You should always prefer graphical elements or logos to photos or screenshots in your icon designs.
